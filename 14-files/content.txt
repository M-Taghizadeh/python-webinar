Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. 
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. 
Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach 
aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. 
Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability 
and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
